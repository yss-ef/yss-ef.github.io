## Technical Overview

The system is built for speed and impact, utilizing modern web standards to create a terminal-like HUD (Heads-Up Display) experience without the overhead of heavy frameworks.

### **Core Stack**
*   **Engine:** Vanilla HTML5 / Modern CSS3 (SCSS Logic)
*   **Logic:** Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
*   **Iconography:** Lucide Icons (Dynamically injected)
*   **Typography:** Google Fonts (Share Tech Mono, Cormorant Garamond, Syne)
*   **Hosting:** GitHub Pages

## System Features

### 1. **Boot Sequence Logic**
The application features a simulated OS initialization sequence (INITIALIZING ICARUS_OS...). This is handled via asynchronous JavaScript to ensure a seamless transition from the boot screen to the main interface once all assets are loaded.

### 2. **Reactive UI & Motion**
*   **Adaptive Cursor:** A custom-engineered bracketed cursor system that reacts to mouse movement with acceleration physics.
*   **Dynamic Grid:** The background grid system utilizes CSS custom properties (--mouse-x, --mouse-y) updated in real-time by JS to create a reactive light-follow effect.
*   **Impact Effects:** Flash feedback on specific system events (like boot completion) to reinforce the industrial feel.

### 3. **Thematic Engine**
The site features a dual-state theme engine (Light/Dark mode) that persists across sessions. The transition includes a custom animation for the icon swap and a global CSS variable shift to maintain the high-contrast aesthetic.

### 4. **Responsive Architecture**
The HUD layout is designed with flexbox and grid, ensuring that the "Terminal" experience scales perfectly from desktop monitors to mobile devices without losing its industrial character.
